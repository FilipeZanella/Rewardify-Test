single click to add/remove obstacles;
double click to select path;

in the second phase, I added a new mode to show details about the pathfinding in runtime. just click in the button on the bottom-left and select the right mode.

every pathfinding iteration is controlled by the user; touch anywhere in the screen to go to the next iteraction.
